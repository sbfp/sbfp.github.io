<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
<p>
    I've been working with information technology & people since late 2008 where I ended my education.
    Since then I've worked as different roles on a multitude of projects and programs. All this allowing me to develop
    both my personal and professional skills.
</p>
<p>
    I absolutely love working as an enterprise architect as I'm working closely with the business while at the same time
    working closely with developers and architects.
    In my opinion this is where the magic happens! We constantly inspire each other to be more ambitious and to find
    clever solutions to our problems might they be business related or pure technical.
</p>
<h5>Personal</h5>
<p>
    I absolutely love to ride my bike, so I do that alot! For me it's a perfect way of keeping in shape and clearing the
    head after a long day of work filled with complex topics and decissions.
    The last couple of years I've managed to train througout the winter so my form is pretty decent üòâ Ping me if you
    wanna go for a ride üö¥üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®
</p>
<p>
    When not riding my bike I love spending time with family and friends. I enjoy a nice dinner in good company. My wife
    and I are also spending quite some time in our garden
    as we're trying to farm as much of the vegtebales we need ourselves. I must admit it's mostly her idea and effort,
    but I help a little now and then üòá

    Feel free to reach out if you want to know more about what I do or are doing similar work - I love to share and
    learn!

            We were set out to build the best homebank app in DK using best in class technology and working
            methodologies. We wanted to deliver a unique experience on both mobile a web.
            This was acheived by applying a mobile-first mindset and using Angular, Nativescript with and a rather
            complex build setup building to both iOS, Android & web.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was one of the most complex working scenarios I've every been in both because of all the new technology
            & because we needed to find new and clever ways of working together.
            As lead architect my resposibility was to ensure that we didn't cut too many corners and ensure that we
            found the right solutions and technical designs for our problems.
            At this project there were a lot of new tech for everyone, so we also needed to spend some time guiding and
            helping each other take responsibility in our new roles.

            I was asked to be architect on this big real-estate program. The program should replace an old 3rd party real-easte platform
            that Totalkredit had been delivering to our advisors. Totalkredit decided that they instead would expose API's and no UI. this
            should instead be developed in the different Bank Centrals ensuring effective implementation with the advisors other tools and systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was on the program from the start hence I was in on all the big decissions regarding technology and architecture. This was very exciting because 
            we went from monolithic portal java development to single page Angular app, and moved from Monoliths to Microservices in containers. We also gained alot of
            experience with automated testing and how much confidence is needed for actually doing trunk-based development. I my humble opinion we actually got a couple of 
            real devops teams going.
